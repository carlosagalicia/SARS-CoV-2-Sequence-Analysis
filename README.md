# SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Analysis

This repository contains an integrative project analyzing the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants from the 20 countries with the highest reported cases. The project explores genetic similarities and differences between variants, focusing on their distribution across Asian, Hispanic, European, and African populations.

## Files
- `Evidence_2_Integrative_Project.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the complete analysis, including hierarchical clustering, phylogenetic trees, and nucleotide composition comparisons.
- `fastas/`: Directory containing `.fasta` files with genetic sequences for each country included in the analysis.

## Project Overview
The project includes:
1. **Phylogenetic Analysis**:
   - Construction of a phylogenetic tree using the JC69 model.
   - Clustering analysis to identify relationships between variants from different countries.

2. **Sequence Composition**:
   - Analysis of nucleotide composition for variants.
   - Visualization of DNA base counts for each variant.

3. **Key Findings**:
   - Identification of groups with high genetic similarity.
   - Insights into the origins and descent of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carlosagalicia/SARS-CoV-2-Sequence-Analysis.git
